In social network like Facebook or Twitter, people send friend requests and accept othersâ€™ requests as well. Now given two tables as below:
Table: friend_request
| sender_id | send_to_id |request_date|
|-----------|------------|------------|
| 1         | 2          | 2016_06-01 |
| 1         | 3          | 2016_06-01 |
| 1         | 4          | 2016_06-01 |
| 2         | 3          | 2016_06-02 |
| 3         | 4          | 2016-06-09 |
Table: request_accepted
| requester_id | accepter_id |accept_date |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| 1            | 2           | 2016_06-03 |
| 1            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 2            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-09 |
| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-10 |
Write a query to find the overall acceptance rate of requests rounded to 2 decimals, which is the number of acceptance divide the number of requests.
For the sample data above, your query should return the following result.
|accept_rate|
|-----------|
|       0.80|


select
sum (case when b.b.accepter_id is not null then 1 else 0 end)/ count(distinct sender_id) as answer rate
from (select distinct sender_id, sender_to_id from friend_request) a
left join (select distinct requester_id, accepter_id from request_accepted) b
on a.sender_id = b.requester_id and a.send_to_id = b.accepter_id and b.accept_date >= a.request_dte
